# LivingResourceReview

This repository houses the living review of open resources for drug discovery and development for SARS-CoV-2 as described in [our paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-1043/v1) published in _F1000 Research_.

>**Abstract**
In only a matter of months, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world. The global impact of the disease has caused significant and repeated calls for quick action towards new medicines and vaccines. In response, researchers have adopted open science methods to begin to combat this disease via global collaborative efforts. We summarise here some of those initiatives, and have created an updateable list to which others may be added. Though open science has previously been shown as an accelerator of biomedical research, the COVID-19 crisis has made openness seem the logical choice. Will openness persist in the discovery of new medicines, after the crisis has receded?

The purpose of this repository is to provide a hub of open resources dedicated to accelerating COVID-19 research that is maintained and updated by the research community. We have organized these resources into three main categories: 

*Open access*: The availability of research publications that are free to access and, often, re-use.

*Open data*: The same, but with data.

*Open source*: Initiatives in which broader community participation is allowed via liberal licence terms.

### Browsing 

To browse resources, read through the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenSourceSarsCoV2/LivingResourceReview/wiki). Resources are organized by the categories described above and in the paper.

### Adding Content

Anyone can add content to the wiki (for tips on how to do this, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) ). Please try to keep formatting consistent and make sure to add a short description for each item. Discussion about any topic related to the repository may be started by creating an [Issue](https://github.com/OpenSourceSarsCoV2/LivingResourceReview/issues).
